#PAPline
Software package for ancient DNA analysis

### General description

*PAPline* is a software package that aims to ease the analysis of ancient DNA datasets. The package has a lot of tools that can be used both jointly and separately, while there are only standalone tools too. The core feature of PAPline is the raw data analysis, supplemented with e.g. PCA visualisation tool for *smartpca* output, clinical variant analysis, sex determination, haplogroup classification via *haplogrep* and *Yleaf*, etc. Each has its own directory with README files, please carefully read these before use!

Most tools for the current version are written in bash and R programming languages, but as we extend the available set of tools and features python may play a significant role in the future. When using *PAPline* please cite [Gerber et al. 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.03.478968v2).
